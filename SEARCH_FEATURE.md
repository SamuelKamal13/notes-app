## 🎨 Design Details

### Search Bar Styling

```dart
- Rounded corners: 14px
- Modern filled style with subtle background
- Focus state: Primary color (indigo) border
- Clear icon: Appears when text is present
- Auto-focus: Yes
```

- Sub-text: "Create some notes first"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created

- `lib/widgets/search_notes_view.dart` - Complete search view widget

### Files Modified

- `lib/views/notes_view.dart` - Added navigation to search

### How It Works

1. **State Management**: Uses StatefulWidget to manage search state
2. **Real-time Filtering**: Filters notes on every keystroke
3. **BlocBuilder**: Integrates with existing NotesCubit
4. **Case-insensitive**: Converts both query and notes to lowercase
5. **Efficient**: Only rebuilds when necessary

### Search Algorithm

```dart
// Searches both title and content
_filteredNotes = _allNotes.where((note) {
  final titleLower = note.title.toLowerCase();
  final contentLower = note.subTitle.toLowerCase();
  final searchLower = query.toLowerCase();
  return titleLower.contains(searchLower) ||
      contentLower.contains(searchLower);
}).toList();
```

## 💡 Search Tips for Users

   - Search for partial words
   - Try different keywords if not found

2. **Quick Navigation**:

   - Tap a result to edit immediately
   - Use back button to return to search
